While migrating sites do the following:

1.	Migrate everything but the workflows (Do necessary modification to the settings in the Sharegate to skip workflows)
2.	During cutover window:

1.	Unpublish the workflow from the source.
2.	Migrate the delta content and disabled workflow to the new site.
3.	Publish the workflow in both the old site and the new site.

If the site does not have any workflows then go ahead with the usual approach.

Let’s ensure we don’t rely on tool on this piece of work.
